This Chess Game program was made by Ori Aharonof, Neria Ovad and Yehonatan Natan
and is the result of a lot of time and effort.
We hope that you will find this game fun to play.
Notes:
1. The gui is dynamic to your screen resolution
2. There is no need to open the GUI engine before starting the program, it does that on it's own
3. When starting, the program asks you if you want to load a file. This is used to load previously created saves
4. The program uses *.txt format to save it's files
5. We improved the GUI to look better
6. We made the GUI run on full screen
7. We set the GUI's icon to a better one
8. We added an ascii art to the console ;-)
9. Look at the console in the end of every game. It has the history of all moves you and the
   opponet did in the previous game.

- sincerly, CHESS INC
